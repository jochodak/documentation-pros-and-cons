* **ADVANTAGES**  

  * On the main page there is a division into major topics. A user can select which topic he is interested in and go from there to a more detailed page. 
  * There is an interesting concept of *‘teams in space’* introduced
  * Thanks to the link maps on the right a user can check where he is, and which points have been learned 
  * ‘Related content’ on the right side can help a user to find related topics and queries 
  * Release notes can be easily accessed
   
* **DISADVANTAGES**
  * Some screenshots are of poor quality (Image 1) 
  * Section called “In this section” very often repeats what is already on the left side of the page

* **DISADVANTAGES**  


  * Community Section – a uer can find questions and discussions regarding the Jira software there, which is a significant help for users that have issues with the software. However, most of the questions are left unanswered. The lack of monitoring of the section can demotivate someone to post a question.
